Problem:

There are four files:
QueryItemRank.csv - This is a comma-separated file containing
QueryID, URLID, DisplayedRank, Impressions, Clicks

RankAvgCtr.csv - This is a comma-separated file containing
Rank, clicksPerImpression

Popularity.csv - This is a comma-separated file containing a number between 0 to 100 indicating the popularity of URLID

Test.csv - This is a comma-separated file containing  QueryID, followed by 10 URLIDs.

Your goal is to write an algorithm that ranks URLIDs for each QueryID from test.csv file.

Your solution should contain: An output csv file containing a (QueryID, URLID, score) row for each line in Test.csv.

Runnable code that produces this output.
